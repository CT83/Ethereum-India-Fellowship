## The Application Process

This is a general overview of the application and selection process.

1. #### Submit the Application through a Google Form - (~10 mins)

   Pretty self-explanatory, the application asked us about our past projects, our experience in software development and why we would like to learn more about Blockchain. 

2. #### Give a Remote Interview - (~15 mins)

   I was interviewed by my soon-to-be mentor [Vaibhav](https://twitter.com/vaibhavchellani), & [Denver](https://twitter.com/denverjude), who represented DevFolio.  The interview was pretty informal affair, we talked tech, I walked them through [FRAS - An (almost) Decentralized Facial Recognition System with Raspberry Pi Zeros](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-use-facial-recognition-rpi-zeros-turn-your-school-rohan-sawant/) one of my older side projects, Vaibhav even talked about [HashCash - A crypto-economic protocol to build better public communication tools](https://hackmd.io/@n2eVNsYdRe6KIM4PhI_2AQ/rkiV79oDI). To sum it up, it was a pretty engaging ordeal!
